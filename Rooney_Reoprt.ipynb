    "## Good Evening, Mr. Rooney\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Rebqa Yohannes, and I am the new Vice President of Analytics here with the Wizards. You asked me to help identify players who are performing at a high level but are not being paid to match their achievements. I intend to find the kind of players we can afford to bring in and will immediately make a difference in our teams performance. I have delievered this to you!\n",

    "## Step 1: Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by combining two separate datasets: one containing every NBA player's salary for the 2025-26 season, and another containing their statistics from the past seasons game. This influded things like how many points they scored, rebounds and assists they had, minutes they played, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "After combining the two datasets and cleaning the data, meaning removing incomplete rows, fixing salary values that had dollar signs and commas in them so the computer could read them as actual numbers, and removing duplicate player entries, I ended up with a clean dataset.\n"

    "## Step 2: What are we looking at\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every column in the data was useful. I removed columns for three main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **just ID or tracking codes** with no relationship to how a player performs, things like row numbers and IDs.\n",
    "- **redundant** — for example, I kept Total Rebounds instead of keeping Offensive Rebounds and Defensive Rebounds separately, since Total Rebounds already captures both. Keeping all three would have made rebounding seem three times more important than other stats and would incorrectly inflate the data.\n",
    "- **irrrelevant** — things like what team a player is on or what position they play do not tell us whether they are underpaid or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stats I kept were: Age, Games Played, Minutes Played, Effective Field Goal Percentage, Total Rebounds, and Total Points. These give us a well-rounded picture of a player's overall contribution without repeating the same information twice."

    "## Step 3: Grouping players by performance\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a technique called k-means clustering. K-means clustering sorts through all the NBA players based on how good they are. It will be seperated into clusters that will indicate which players don't perform well and are paid above the median salary, best performers with below median salary, and mediocre players with above median minutes played but below median salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important detail: I intentionally left salary out of the grouping process. The whole point was to let the computer group players based only on what they do on the court then compare those groups to their actual pay. That is how we find the mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the algorithm I also had to standardize the data, which just means putting all the stats on the same scale. Without this step, a stat like Total Points (which might be in the hundreds) would completely overpower a stat like EFG%, which is a small decimal."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Step 4: What's the right number of groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I could group the players I had to figure out how many groups to use. I tested grouping players into 1 through 10 groups and measured how clean and tight each grouping was. When I plotted the results on a chart, an elbow plot, the line bent sharply and started to flatten at three groups. The bend is indicative of three being the sweet spot, adding more groups beyond that point does not improve things enough to be worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also calculated a silhouette score of 0.2335, which measures how cleanly separated the groups are from each other. In basketball data, a score between 0.2 and 0.4 is normal and acceptable, players do not fall into perfectly clean boxes in real life, and that is fine. "

    "## Step 5: What the 3 groups look like\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the analysis, the algorithm sorted every player into one of three performance tiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Tier** — High points, high minutes. The players teams build around these type of players and pay accordingly.\n",
    "- **Mid Tier** — Good contributors. Show up, play real minutes. Not as flashy as target tier, but pretty reliable.\n",
    "- **Low Tier** — Limited contributors. Low minutes, low stats. These are mostly bench players/injured players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization I created plots every player by Minutes Played on the x-axis and Total Points on the y-axis, the two stats most closely tied to salary. The color of each dot represents the player's actual salary. Players who are in the upper right of the chart but have a light color are producing like star players while being paid like low-tier players. Those are our targets for recruitment.\n"
